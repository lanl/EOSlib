For use as reactant EOS for HE, expansion region needed for
    PTequilibrium (reactants with products) to be robust.
The idea of 0. and 1. is for expansion region to become stiffened gas EOS.
Otherwise domain is limited by c^2 going negative.


0.  Cut-off cold curve, P= Pmin for V > Vmax
    Needed for qualitatively correct behavior in expansion

1. Modify Gamma such that
    Gamma(V) = g0 + g1*(V/V0) + g2*(V/V0)^2
    Adjust coefficients for V > V0 in order that
        Gamma and its derivative are continuous at V=V0
        Asymptotically, Gamma -> constant as V->infty

2.  Add function
        Emin(V) = ec(V), i.e., make energy on cold curve accessible
    Modify
        NotInDomain(V,e) = ( V <= 0 || e < Emin(V) )
        Note P < 0 allowed ?, c_T^2 < 0 allowed ?
        
3. Specify specific heat by spline
   More general and eliminates need for ODE
   Similarly, can replace specify Gamma by spline.
