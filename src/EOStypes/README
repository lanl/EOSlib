EOStypes contains sub-directories for each type of EOS.
Currently implemented are:
    IdealGas
    StiffenedGas
    Hayes
    BirchMurnaghan
    VonMisesElasticPlastic
    EqPorous
    FrozenPorous
    DissipativePorous
    JWL
    HEfit
Run
    ../Compile
This will call MakeSource to compile subdirectories

Test programs:

1. Within subdirectory for each EOS type
    Test1 linked with lib.a
    Test2 linked with lib.so and dynamic linking
        default database = ./Test.data

2. TestRiemann
    Solves Riemann problem for ideal gases
    with either specialized or generic solver (default is both)
    Timing test on 800 Mhz Pentium III PC (g++ version 2.96)

time TestRiemann generic     count 1000000
user    0m28.140s
---
time TestRiemann specialized count 1000000
user    0m10.980s

    Relative time depends on how far along wave curve solution lies.
    In the default example, specialized IdealGas Riemann solver is
        roughly 3 times faster than generic Riemann solver.
    Specialied solver takes 10 micro-seconds for each solution to
        Riemann problem with ideal gases.
    Generic Riemann solver uses specialized IdealGas routines
        for Hugoniot locus and Rarefaction curve,
        i.e., analytic formula rather than zero finder for Hugoniot
              and ODE integrator for Rarefaction.
    Generic solver with general EOS would take significantly longer.
