EOS models currently implemented
    IdealGas
    StiffenedGas
    Hayes
    GenHayes
    MieGruneisen
    Sesame
    EqPorous, equilibirum porous EOS
    Uniaxial (depricated)
ExtEOS models
    Elastic1D
      uniaxial strain, stress^xx = hydro_component + shear_components
    ElasticPlastic1D
      Elastic1D + Yield function + plastic strain rate

EOS parameters have units
    low level routines provided to convert units
--------------------
Version 2.0.1 runs on
    Linux
      gcc v4.1
      or version that has standard C++98 header files
-----------------------------------------------------------
                    INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
1.  ./Install [dir]
    where dir is name of installation directory with subdirs include, lib, bin
        include is machine independent (except for a few #ifdef)
        lib/$os and bin/$os for machine dependent executables
    For test purposes dir maybe . or empty
    Makefiles are automatically generated
------------------
In case of trouble
------------------
0. Check automated makefile routines compiled
   make _MakeMake

1. Localize problem by installing in pieces
   make libs    	    # for general purpose libraries
   make eos    	        # for equation of state libraries
   make Applications    # Compiles Wave = code for calculating wave curve, etc

2. Further localize problem by compiling individual library
   cd [lib_name]
   ../Compile
   ../Compile install
   Most subdirectories have test programs
   which can be run with
   ../Compile Test    # see Depend file for specifics
   or by hand,  for example, TestCalc

3. To change operating system for eos lib
   make cleanup    	# removes operating system dependent makefiles
   make Cleanup    	# removes everything but source

4. Fresh start
   make RealClean

README    		(this file)
Run             script to set default database file and set environment
                variable SharedLibDirEOS
                Example:
                Run Wave [options]
                is equivalent to (with <EOSlib> filled in appropriately)
                    SharedLibDirEOS=<EOSlib>/lib/Linux
                    export SharedLibDirEOS
                    bin/Linux/Wave file <EOSlib>/DATA/EOS.data [options]
SetEnv          For debugging
                source SetEnv
                sets SharedLibDirs environment variable

Note: Use shell script Run to
      1. sets environment variable for shared library used by database,
      2. sets default database DATA/EOS.data
      3. runs appropriate machine dependent executable in bin/$os
