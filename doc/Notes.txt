Notes on thermo for EOS paper

The physical setting for an equation of state (EOS) is thermodynamics.
The EOSlib is aimed at single phase materials
with specific volume and specific energy as independent variables.

The EOS base class is a collection of functions that defines an interface
so that all EOS models can be treated the same.
Different EOS models are derived classes.
The derived class also contain parameters for evaluating EOS functions.
The interface allows for generic functions for evaluating important
hydrodynamic properties such as the solution to a Riemann problem
for any two materials.

For an incomplete EOS, the only requires function is P(V,e) for pressure.
Generic functions are provided for important derivatives;
the sound speed, Gruneisen coefficient and fundamental derivative.
Higher level functions are provided for shock (Hugoniot) locus and isentrope.

For a complete EOS, the interface provides functions for other thermodynamic
variables; temperature and entropy as well as derived variables
sound speed, bulk modulus, specific heat, Gruneisen coefficient
and coefficient of thermo expansion.

Model EOS have domains outside which some functionality is lost.
Important limitations on the EOS domain are from:
1. Thermodynamic consistency, de = -P dV + T dS,
   that is the EOS model can be derived from a thermodynamic potential.
2. Thermodynamic stability
   specific heat, C_P >= C_T >= 0
   bulk modulus,  K_S >= K_T >= 0
This allows for the use of thermodynamic identities that relate various
thermodynamic quantities, such as isentropic and isothermal bulk modulus.

The EOSlib also provides class EOS_VT with V and T as independent variables.

The EOSlib also provides for an extended EOS with internal degrees of freedom
that are useful for hydrodynamics with rate equations;
such as reactive flow and 1-D elastic plastic flow.
