Simple examples of using EOSlib

1. LowLevelHugoniot.C
    Instantiates class IdealGas
    Initializes Hugoniot class for IdealGas
    Calculates point on Hugoniot locus with specified V

   LowLevelHugoniot.sh
     shell script to compile, link and run

2. HugoniotDB.C
    Fetches EOS pointer IdealGas from EOS database
    Initialize Hugoniot class for EOS
    Calculates point on Hugoniot locus with specified V

   HugoniotDB.sh
     shell script to compile, link and run

3. Cleanup.sh
    shell script to remove *.o and executable files
    generated by LowLevelHugoniot.sh and HugoniotDB.sh

4. CMakeLists.txt
    CMake file to compile and link LowLevelHugoniot and HugoniotDB
    cmake generates directory CMakeFiles and file Makefile
