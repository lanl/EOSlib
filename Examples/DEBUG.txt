Loader issue with initializing Calc::init_func on Mac

Starting in build/Examples

1. Add diagnostic output to Calc
cp Function.C ../../eoslib/src/CClib/Calc/Subs/Function.C

# to revert
( cd ../../eoslib; git checkout src/CClib/Calc/Subs/Function.C; )

2. Rerun make
( cd ..; make -j4; )

3. Run
./Test.sh   # successfully

4. Test.C comment out /** Calc line **/
./Test.sh   # fails on first FetchEOS

5. Test.C comment out, in addition, first FetchEOS
./Test.sh   # successful, last Fetch same as #4 that failed

6. modify Test.sh -lEOS instead of -lEOStypes
./Test.sh   # fails at last Fetch
